          <h1>What is athletics?</h1>
          <p>Athletics is a group of sporting events that involves competitive running, 
            jumping, throwing, and walking.[1] The most common types of athletics 
            competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running, and racewalking.

            The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, 
            where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that 
            achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. 
            The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive 
            equipment, makes athletics one of the most common types of sports in the world. 
            Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and 
            competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.
            
            Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC. 
            The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western 
            Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread 
            to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are held under the 
            auspices of World Athletics, the global governing body for the sport of athletics, 
            or its member continental and national federations.
            
            The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The foremost 
            international athletics meeting is the World Athletics Championships, which 
            incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level 
            competitions in athletics include the World Athletics Cross Country Championships 
            and the World Half Marathon Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete 
            at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics Championships.
            
            The word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀθλητής (athlētēs, "combatant in 
            public games") from ἆθλον (athlon, "prize") or ἆθλος (athlos, "competition"). Initially, 
            the term described athletic contests in general – i.e. sporting competition based primarily 
            on human physical feats. In the 19th century, the term athletics acquired a more narrow 
            definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, 
            jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be prominent in the United Kingdom and 
            the former British Empire. Related words in Germanic and Romance languages also have a 
            similar meaning.
            
            In much of North America, athletics is synonymous with sports in general, maintaining 
            the historical usage of the term. The word "athletics" is rarely used to refer to the 
            sport of athletics in this region. Track and field is preferred, and is used in the 
            United States and Canada to refer to athletics events, including racewalking and 
            marathon running (although cross country running is typically considered a separate sport).</p>

          <h2>Why is athletics important to our lives?</h2>
          <p>Many young students dream of one day playing sports professionally and grow up regarding 
            star athletes as their heroes. Though very few students go pro, many continue to value 
            athletics for a lifetime. This is often because playing a sport provides opportunities 
            that nothing else can, even opportunities outside of athletics.

           
            For one, top tier athletes can receive scholarships to attend college and 
            continue their athletic and professional careers; some students would not 
            be able to attend college otherwise. This opportunity is life-altering for 
            the small percentage of students it's available to because a college education 
            influences almost every aspect of life after graduation.
            
            For the majority, however, high school is the last time to play organized 
            sports for a number of reasons. With that said, there are plenty of choices 
            for those that stop athletics when handed a diploma but want to keep sports in 
            their lives—coaching is just one terrific way to stay involved. Many successful 
            coaches today were once average players with a passion for and understanding of 
            their game to spare. Some students might also realize their strengths in sports 
            management or sports medicine as a result of school athletics.
            
            
            Athletics can also provide opportunities through relationships. Players on a team often 
            grow close and form lasting bonds, bonds that can support students well beyond high 
            school or college. Staying connected can also afford people job and mentorship 
            opportunities or it could simply provide them with life-long friends.</p>

          <h3>What is the history of athletics?</h3>
          <p>Athletic contests in running, walking, jumping and throwing are among  
            the oldest of all sports and their roots are prehistoric. Athletics 
            events were depicted in the Ancient Egyptian tombs in Saqqara, with 
            illustrations of running at the Heb Sed festival and high jumping appearing 
            in tombs from as early as of 2250 BC. The Tailteann Games were an ancient 
            Celtic festival in Ireland, founded circa 1800 BC, and the thirty-day meeting 
            included running and stone-throwing among its sporting events. The original 
            and only event at the first Olympics in 776 BC was a stadium-length running 
            event known as the stadion. This later expanded to include throwing and jumping 
            events within the ancient pentathlon. Athletics competitions also took place at 
            other Panhellenic Games, which were founded later around 500 BC.</p>

          <h4>Why do people compete in the olimpics?</h4>
          <p>Kenya first participated at the Olympic Games in 1956, and has sent athletes 
            to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the boycotted 
            1976 and 1980 Games. Kenya participated in the Winter Olympic Games in 1998, 
            2002, 2006 and 2018. Kenyan athletes have won 103 medals in total, all from 
            boxing and track and field events, making them the most successful African 
            committee at the Olympics. In terms of total medals won, the most recent 
            Summer Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016) have been Kenya's most successful, 
            producing 42 medals between them.

            The number of Kenyan women winning Olympic medals has risen dramatically, 
            from their first in 1996 to more than half the Kenyan medals in 2016 (seven).
            
            Increasingly, Kenya-born athletes are immigrating to compete in the Olympics 
            for other countries, most notably Bahrain. In the 2016 Olympics, there were 
            ~20 such athletes, including multiple medal winners.
            
            The National Olympic Committee for Kenya is the National Olympic Committee Kenya, 
            founded in 1955.</p>
